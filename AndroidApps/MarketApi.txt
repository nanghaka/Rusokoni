Getting All Markets in the Db
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the library will spit XML so to get JSON, you ask for it either by setting the header as in cURL -H, or you append format/json to the url.  

JSON
All Markets
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/markets
curl http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/markets/format/json



Filtering Markets by Location 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rusokoni Market Api is divided into two the normal xml file which can be got directly by accessing the link 

curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/markets/lat/0.330166/lng/32.613954/range/2 

Incase you want the json format then you format it by adding format/json 

curl http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/markets/lat/0.330166/lng/32.613954/range/2/format/json 

The lat and long are passed respectively through 

lat/{value}/lng/{value} 

The range/2 is the radius of coverage 

range{radius in km}

Incase one wants to get locations from a specific Location all that is needed is their location which can be pinged through browser and mobile GPS enabled phones 


Getting Markets from a specific Market
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market Prices (the id below is the id of a market, can be retrieved from the above json call)
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/prices/id/1
curl http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/prices/id/1/format/json

where 

prices/id/{id of the market}

* The API has got more security implemented based on the Rest Api digest authentication

More additional information to the Api
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the api growing the way it is, I thought it was time to put in some security features.
From now on, all requests to the api should include the username and password using digest authentication like below. This ensures that we are only processing requests from authorized sources. Saves us from random bots hitting the server and raising the load.
You might want to look at the controller (application/controllers/api/rest.php). The code is not that complicated, for most of the stuff you need, you can probably code it in yourself.
I've added the following to the api.
Get active countries (You need the country id when registering)
curl --digest -u rusokoni_api:zZj0IdM0wC\"2e4M http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/countries
Signup (After successful signup it returns the authentication token. Do as much validation as you can on the client side before posting to the api)
curl --digest -u rusokoni_api:zZj0IdM0wC\"2e4M -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d '{"email":"rusokoni_api@rusokoni_api1.com","password":"password", "first_name":"rusokoni_api","last_name":"istrator","user_country":"227"}' http://rusokoni.orgï»¿/index.php/api/rest/signup
Get authentication token
curl --digest -u rusokoni_api:zZj0IdM0wC\"2e4M -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d '{"email":"rusokoni_api@rusokoni_api.com","password":"password"}' http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/login
Use authentication token for actions that require the user to be logged in
curl --digest -u rusokoni_api:zZj0IdM0wC\"2e4M -H "Accept: application/json" http://rusokoni.org/index.php/api/rest/checklogin/token/eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjEifQ.HP83zAYkYrBuKEeuiQqDfE7x0BvvZf9D-eN62YTvJwk2D
